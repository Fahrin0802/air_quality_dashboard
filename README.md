# AIR-QUALITY-DASHBOARD

## INTRODUCTION
The Air quality monitoring dashboard enables users to see AQHI values from continuous monitoring stations, pm2.5 concentrations from microsensors, and their overall community AQHI values. This project is developed by ECE 493 students at the University of Alberta, in collaboration with Professor Amina Hussein, Elizabeth Hicks, and the Tomorrow Foundation.

## FEATURES
- Display real-time **PM2.5 concentrations** using PurpleAir sensors.
- Display **AQHI** values from Continuous monitoring stations (derived from Alberta Capital Airshed)
- **GIS Mapping:** Visualize air quality data on a map with interactive features.
- **Customizable Alerts:** Receive email alerts based on user-defined air quality thresholds (in development).
